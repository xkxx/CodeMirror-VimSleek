CodeMirror-VimSleek
===================

This is a fork of the original CodeMirror Vim mode that provides vim-seek among other things that (imho) improves the Vim experience on CodeMirror. It works on LightTable as a drop-in replacement for the vanilla Vim plugin, and otherwise replaces `vim.js` on any CodeMirror-based editors. Some of its features might drive vintage Vim users nuts, though.

## Features

* vim-seek with `s` & `S`. `;` and `,` repeats seeking in forward/backward direction
* Removes `f` & `F` (adding them back should be very simple though), and replaces them with pagewise seek (like seek, but searches the entire screen). Works with `;` and `,` too.
* `t` & `T` now does tail seek like `x` in vim-seek.
* Working `g` flag in substitute (Will commit to upstream).
* Yank that does not copy extra character after the cursor. (Will commmit to upstream).
* Copies to/Pastes from system clipboard when no register is specified. (Only works in node-webkit based editors, will silently fail otherwise)
* Maps `U` to redo. It used to map to do nothing.
* Maps `C-k` & `C-j` to page-up/down. They used to do nothing.
* Maps `C--` & `C-+` to walk backward/forward in jumplist.
* Compatibility with LightTable - works as a plugin.
* Moar in development

This repo will stay updated with upstream and works with latest version of CodeMirror.

## Installation on LightTable

First, remove the vanilla Vim plugin.

Then nagivate to:

mac: `~/Library/Application Support/LightTable`
linux: `~/.config/LightTable`
windows: `%APPDATALOCAL%/LightTable`

Download this repo and throw it in the plugins folder. Should work out of the gate.
